# Chapter One Reading Response
## Two Things New to Me
1. "Live coding gives us a way to think otherwise
about coding—what it *can be*, rather than what it *is*."
    * I've never thought that coding could be used in an improvisational context.
2. "*Big Tech* wants computers to be invisible so our
experience of using them becomes seemingly natural."
    * Accessibility in interface design makes users more likely to embrace the technology, but with this, it becomes more difficult to understand the extent to which it affects human behavior or culture.
## Two Things Not New to Me
1. "Artists were beginning to use code as a creative material to express music, visuals, choreography, robotics,
video, and computer games."
    * I was familiar with the idea of using code in these mediums. Some of my favorite artists have used Max/MSP and PureData.
2. "However, we argue that all performance practices (including music) offer a special way of understanding software and that this has radical potential for all software—not
only for artists, their audiences, and art theorists but also for engineers, philosophers,
and activists."
    * I'm aware of the implications of the practices within software, specifically in its advancements and how it could greatly affect communication and the future of these fields.
